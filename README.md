# Work Day Scheduler

## About

One of the key components to a sucessful and productive day is to have a game plan. There are many ways in which you could do this, such as: a planner, notes, or an assistant if you have the \$\$ to hire one. For those of us not able to afford an assistant (yet...), a simple scheduler like this one can boost your productivity for the day.

## Details

Upon loading the app, the page is populated with the current day and any previously saved tasks for an hour block. The user may update and save the tasks for each hour block. Each time block is color coded on whether that hour block has passed (grey), is currently at (red), or is upcoming (green).

## Possible Future Features

- Active clock.
- Hour block colors update on hour change.
- Sound on new hour block
- Additional indicators of which hour it currently is.
- Ability to save and access different day schedule.

## Technologies Used

This application was built with basic html, css, and javascript. Libraries used are jQuery and Bootstrap.

## Homework Notes

I found trying to build the html from the given style classes was more confusing than me approaching the problem in my own way. I used as much as I could from the given styles but veered away from it later.
